# Assignment-1
Create a Data Visualization in processing 

The data set I've collected is statistics for my favourite player in the WNBA, Skylar Diggins. It's her game stats for every game she played last season. 

it uses a line graph to indicate her total rebounds for each game. It also uses an interactive line graph and pie chart for displaying points and fouls. 

Seeing the information layed out this way is a much better indication of her ability rather than just numbers in a spreadsheet, which is how the wnba releases it's stats for each player. 

I used control p5 for a menu as my advanced part of the assignment
