Create a Data Visualization in processing 

The data set I've collected is statistics for my favourite player in the WNBA, Skylar Diggins. It's her game stats for every game she played last season. 

it uses a bar chart to indicate her total rebounds for each game. It also uses an interactive line graph and pie chart for displaying points and fouls. 

Seeing the information layed out this way is a much better indication of her ability rather than just numbers in a spreadsheet, which is how the wnba releases it's stats for each player. 


My first graph displays the total number of points she scores per game. As you move the mouse across the screen the basketball moves to the next point on the graph and displays the data for that game

My simple bar chart displays her total rebounds per game. The menu I made from controlp5 can be seen down the bottom of the screen. I used the controller button.

My last graph is a piechart. The segment the mouse position is hovering over enlarges. You can change the output given of each segment by clicking between the data buttons. This is done through controlp5
